    - Added view selector to switch between views (currently only windows view and applications view)
    - Added base abstract class XfdashboardView which all views are derived from
    - Tried to clean up layout and using layout manager in a more correct way when setting up stage
    - Added a fill box layout manager which always expands an actor in the opposite direction as the actors laid out
    - Added viewpad which shows view selector and the active view. Currently scroll bars are always shown

    Set minimum version of external libraries as requirements to avoid using macros not available and makes handling different version a lot harder. BTW libwnck below 2.10 is
    very old and hardly in use nowadays so we can not support these versions. Also made compiler more quiet with -std=gnu99 but should be still warn.
