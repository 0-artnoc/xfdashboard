    Set minimum version of external libraries as requirements to avoid using macros not available and makes handling different version a lot harder. BTW libwnck below 2.10 is
    very old and hardly in use nowadays so we can not support these versions. Also made compiler more quiet with -std=gnu99 but should be still warn.

    Allow libwnck library prior to version 3.0 and provide version checks
    macros in this case. Changed also stupid Makefile to reflect this.
